##Chat System


This project is a simple chat like facebook chat you can start using the system by register and login then you will be redirected to chat page so you can see all system users on the left sidebar and their statuses changes periodically.
By clicking on any name from the left sidebar you can start chatting with him.
You can send the message by clicking on ENTER button and you can use SHIFT+ENTER to get a new line without sending the message.


## Technical Choices
I used the following technologies to get this system online:-
1. Twitter Bootstrap: to make a responsive design that can be best viewed in all screen sizes.
2. Angular JS: to make frontend with easy and moduled structure.
3. AJAX: to make requests getting online users and chat messages.
4. PHP: for backend using Codeigniter framework.
5. MySQL: database engine.

## Design
Using Bootstrap I make a very simple design for two main pages (Home page - chat page)

## Demo
You can view a demo for this simple system with the following details:-
